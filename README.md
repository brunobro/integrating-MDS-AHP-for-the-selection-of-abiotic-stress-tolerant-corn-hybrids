# Integrating Multidimensional Scaling and Automated AHP for the Selection of Abiotic-Stress-Tolerant Corn Hybrids
This script implements a decision support system (DSS) for ranking and selecting 
corn (Zea mays L.) hybrids with higher tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses 
(drought, salinity, and aluminum toxicity). The methodology combines 
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and the Automated Analytic Hierarchy Process (AAHP) 
to provide a single, objective tolerance score for each hybrid.
